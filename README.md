### Analysis

- I decided to add a few more Drug Regimens to the box plot. It definetly gave more insight. 

- pymaceuticals_AMP is the name of my jupyter notebook file

 - First, the one and only outlier listed for this subset looks like it may be an incorrect data point, given that no other regimens have outliers. And looking at the origal data, the tumor volume declined and the mouse only lived to 5 months with no metastatic sites. I would take out this mouse (c326), similar to how g989 was expunged.
 - Second, I would say that Capomulin and Ramicane were more effective in keeping down the tumor volume than the other 6 regimens looked at.
 - Third, I would say that the other regimens were even ineffective since their boxplots closely resemeble that of the placebo. This is based on their effects on the volume size of the tumors, and not looking at lifespans which may yield different results.
